**Where Are You Going?** is an interactive mini web game designed for third-grade primary school students. The game focuses on helping learners recognize and follow simple 1–2 step directions related to getting around town. It supports the development of listening comprehension skills by encouraging students to listen carefully and respond to short, clear audio instructions.

The game then presents a sequence of short audio
instructions supported by visual elements. At each step, the student must identify the instruction they hear and choose the correct option from the alternatives shown on screen, such as directional arrows or simple actions.
